## ⚠️ Why I Dropped the Course After Day 45

The original course switched to **text-heavy content** and skipped real project work after Day 45. It no longer felt valuable.

So I made a bold decision:
> 🚀 From Day 46 onward, I’m building my **own path** —  
> real-world projects, tools, Git, web dev, automation, and cybersecurity prep.

No more hand-holding.  
Just **learning by doing.**

---

## 🔄 New Learning Path (Post-Day 45)

I’m now diving into:

- 🔁 Git & GitHub workflows  
- 🌐 Flask (Python web framework)  
- 🎮 Pygame for fun projects  
- 🤖 Automation scripts  
- 📡 Cybersecurity foundations (Networking, Linux, Port Scanners, etc.)

---

## 🧠 Guidelines (Updated)

- ✅ 1 commit/day = 1 win
- 🛠️ Tools over theory
- 🚀 Always build something, no matter how small
- 📢 Log progress + post updates on LinkedIn

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python 3.x  
- Git + GitHub  
- VS Code  
- Flask, Tkinter, Pygame  
- Duckie 🐤 (ChatGPT as my personal coach)

---

## 🛡️ Why I'm Doing This

To become a confident developer & security expert, building the skills to protect and create.  
My ultimate goal is to make **$100K+** as a **Cybersecurity Pro**, and this journey is my first major step.

---

## 🚀 What's Next?

- Daily logs: custom challenges, Git, Flask, game dev, automation  
- Post consistent progress on LinkedIn  
- Finish strong — my way, no excuses.
